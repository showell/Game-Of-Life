This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, in coffeescript.

The [original JS version](https://gist.github.com/908317#file_game_of_life.html) of this program has more comments.

There is also a [screencast](http://www.viddler.com/explore/Showell/videos/1/) of the original JS version.  It won't live long on viddler (one month), but if you let me know ASAP that you are interested in it, I will try to host it somewhere more permanent.
